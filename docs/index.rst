The Melexis MLX90615 is a miniature Infra Red Thermometer for non-contact temperature measurements. Both the IR sensitive thermopile detector chip and the signal conditioning ASIC are integrated in the same miniature TO-46 can.

With its small size, this infrared thermometer is especially suited for medical applications like ear or forehead thermometers or other applications.

The infrared thermometer comes factory calibrated with a digital SMBus output giving full access to the measured temperature in the complete temperature range(s) with a resolution of 0.02 °C. The sensor achieves an accuracy of ±0.2 °C within the relevant medical temperature range; more information at `Melexis dedicated page <http://www.melexis.com/Infrared-Thermometer-Sensors/Infrared-Thermometer-Sensors/MLX90615-685.aspx>`_
